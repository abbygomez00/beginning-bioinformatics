Tool/model & version: ChatGPT 5 Free Version
What I asked for: I gave it the given prompts that Rosalind gave, and asked it to explain in detail and break down the code for me
Snippet of prompt(s): "Given: Two positive integers a and b (a<b<10000).Return: The sum of all odd integers from a through b, inclusively. Create code using a=100 and b=200. Break down the code for me."
What I changed before committing: If the code gave me an error, then I would fix it by asking ChatGPT further questions, like what the error code meant, to be able to fix the code using the examples in the learning file.
How I verified correctness (tests, sample data): used the sample data from Rosalind to verify that the code got the correct answer
